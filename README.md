# malaria-reports

<i>Currently in development</i><br>
## Description
Automatic report generation for malaria sequencing. <br><br>
Built modularly in Python and HTML, these reports are made to summarize a sequenced DNA sample. <br><br>
Features currently include:
* plots, 
* many at-a-glance read metrics, 
* drug resistance markers, 
* and detection of HRP2 or HRP3 proteins which are necessary for rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).<br><br>

Features such as IGV and coverage plots are in development.
